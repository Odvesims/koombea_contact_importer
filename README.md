README

The app can be run live at https://koombea-contact.herokuapp.com

New users could be created using email/password of your choice. A test user is available with the following credentials:

email: test@noemail.com
pass: 123456

In order to run the app locally, it's necessary to run both a redis and sidekiq server to handle the background processes.
